Peer-to-peer visual cryptography scheme (P-P IVCS)
## Description
This study introduces a visual cryptography scheme called Peer-to-peer visual cryptography scheme (P-P IVCS) which share secrets among the members of a set with arbitrary topology. In the proposed P-P IVCS scheme, the network contains n members that include common secrets among some of them (or all). Only one key is allocated to any member. So maximum number of secrets will be C(n,2). Encoding operation of plain imageâ€™s content (that include all of secrets) should contribute some prominent features. First, each single key cannot reveal any secrets. Second, the secret between two participants will be disclosed by superimposing their keys. Third, although there is a common secret between any pair of members, revelation of common secrets is impossible for others. In this method, by adding one member to n-member network, pixel expansion will increase only one unit, whereas, number of secrets will increase up to n units.

## Simulation Result
As the number of itteration has been set on a high value (10^8 and 10^9), the theoritical and simulation results are almost similar.
